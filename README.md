### Proyect for mercadolibre

This is a simple basic search app.
I used sapper because time was short and performance and scalability was important.
My first option was nextJs but quickly changed to sapper for a more agile and fast development.
If any doubts, check here the [docs](https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs/)

### Running the project

Once you have cloned the project, install dependencies and run the project in development mode:

```bash
npm install 
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open it and click around.
